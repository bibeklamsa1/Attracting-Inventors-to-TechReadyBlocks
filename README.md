# Attracting Inventors to TechReadyBlocks

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project explores five patent datasets to uncover patterns in inventor profiles, sectors, and regions in order to help **TechReadyBlocks** (a Musimorph platform) attract more inventors. The analysis leverages demographic, geographic, and classification data (WIPO, CPC, IPC) to identify high-potential markets and personalization opportunities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To support the **TechReadyBlocks marketing team** in identifying:
- Where inventors are most active
- Which sectors are gaining traction
- What appeals to different inventor profiles

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

1. **California, Japan, and Germany** are top innovation hubs.
2. **Technology and medical WIPO sectors** dominate global filings.
3. **Gender disparity** persists, but female inventor participation is rising in Nordic regions.
4. Sector dominance varies by country: Japan (electronics), US (biotech), Germany (machinery).
5. Filing trends show a steady rise in digital and green-tech innovations post-2015.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The analysis includes 10 Power BI visualizations:
- Top 10 Inventor Countries
- WIPO Sectors by Country
- Gender Distribution of Inventors
- Time Series of Patent Filings
- Inventor Location Map
- Sector Heatmaps
- Classification Overlap (CPC, IPC, WIPO)
- Trend by Male/Female Inventors
- First WIPO Sector Breakdown
- Top Inventor Clusters

All visualizations are stored in the "Techready Patent Analysis" Presentation file and compiled into a Power BI dashboard.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Launch regional outreach campaigns** in innovation-heavy areas like California and Tokyo.
2. **Personalize platform features** based on dominant sectors (e.g., simulation tools for biotech).
3. **Promote diversity programs** to increase engagement among female inventors.

## ðŸ“Œ Call to Action

> Letâ€™s set a meeting with the TechReady marketing team to engage with top inventor regions like California and global hubs to understand their needs and co-create a campaign that aligns with their innovation goals.
